## by Lujain Kotb


## Dataset

Arrival and departure details for 123 million commercial flights throughout the United
States are recorded between October 1987
and December 2008, representing 29 commercial airlines and 3,376 airports. About 2.3 million flights were cancelled, 25 million flights

For the period from 11-2014 -> 11-2020


## Summary of Findings

> ## Univariate Exploration:
> - Almost all the histograms followed a unimodal , right skewed distribution. I made some changes to the data to tidy them cause there seemed to be lots of unresonable value for example more than 20,000 flights in an airport by a single airline in 1 month which seemed hard to believe.
>
> ## Bivariate Exploration:
> - There's an interesting trend here in the year 2020 which has witnesses the largest cancellation rate and lowest diversion rate in all years being examined this can be depicted as due to the pandemic

> ## Multivariate Exploration:
> - The security delays were quite interesting given that a particular airline has had almost no security delays over the past few years, others with increasing rates and some others with decreasing rates and others with no particular pattern or hovering around a certain average.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Just added some titles , labels and legends where appropriate.
